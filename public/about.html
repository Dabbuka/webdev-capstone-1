        <p>Hope you enjoy taking a peek at this resume project I am doing as my first HTML project, it may be incredibly barebones and basic but I suppose everyone needs to start somewhere, and this is going to end up my first project on GitHub.

        My name is Luca Tineo and I am a student at UCLA, with a strong interest in various fields of computer science and at the time of writing, still trying to figure out what my plan of action is and what I really want to do. For now, I am choosing to pick up different skills and see which ones I take an interest in the most. At the moment, I am learning Web Development and plan on picking up HTML, CSS, and JS, along with any other necessities in the world of Webdev. To be quite honest, I don't like to post my face online, so if you want to see that then check out my <a href="./contact.html">Contacts</a> page and peep the LinkedIn or Instagram.
            <br /> <br />
        As for my interests outside of computer science, I have other interests in the humanities such as history (specifically East Asian history) and philosophy. As you may have gathered, I enjoy playing video games and watching anime in my downtime, and take pleasure in overanalyzing them and talking about them way too much with my friends.
